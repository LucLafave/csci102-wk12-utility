#Method Used: I wrote the first function by following what I did in the previous code 10B.
For the second function I opened a file readlines of the file making a list of lines. Then I 
just removed the \n from the list and then returned the list while also closing the file.
For the third function I created a list and then changed string to a list changed the desired value
and turned back into a string. For the fourth function I looked through a list and counted everytime the
word appeared. For the fifth function I looked through the player list and if the player was in the list
I returned that and the same location but for the scores list. The sixth function I just added two lists 
togther. For the seventh function I went through one list and searched if that valued appeared in the second list.
I did this for each value in the first list. In the eigth function I do essentially the same thing but add values 
that were did not match to a list instead of the ones that match.
